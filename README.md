# go-timely-requests

Runs once-daily simple HTTP requests from read from a `.tsv` file.

Each row in the tsv should be in the format:

```
{method}\t{url}\t{hour}\t{minute}\t{second}\t{JSON}
```

Separated by actual tab characters.

The first five fields are mandatory. The sixth field must be a valid JSON on a single line, with no tabs in it.


## Example

```tsv
PUT	http://localhost:8080/topics/rotate	6	30	10
GET	http://localhost:3001/ping	6	30	18
POST	https://httpbin.org/post	7	18	5	{"name":"bob","age":"55"}
```



```bash
‚ùØ go run . jobs.tsv
